# MetroSCREEN
Metabolite and their associated extrinsic and intrinsic regulators screening based on transcriptomic data. 

MetroSCREEN is a computational tool to infer the metabolic states(MetaModule function) and the upstream metabolic regulators (MetaRegulon function) that govern dysregulated metabolic reactions based on scRNA-seq or bulk data.
