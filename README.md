# MetroSCREEN
Metabolite and their associated extrinsic and intrinsic regulators screening based on transcriptomic data. 

MetroSCREEN is a computational tool designed to deduce metabolic states (MetaModule function) and identify upstream extrinsic and intrinsic regulators (MetaRegulon function) that influence dysregulated metabolic reactions, utilizing either scRNA-seq or bulk data.
